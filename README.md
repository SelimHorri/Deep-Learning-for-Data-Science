# Infomration about Deep Learning and how Deep Learning works?

The entire idea behind Deep Learning is to mimic how human brains work given that the human brain is one of the most powerful tool for learning. When comparing to the human brain, Neural Networks refer to systems of neurons, either organic or artificial in nature. Neuron is the basic building block of the Neural Networks. Figure 1 visualizes the architecture of a neuron. A neuron has a body, located in the left lower part of the figure, with so branches emerging from it that are referred as Dendrites (the receiver of the signal) and it has an Axon (the transmitters of the signals), which is that long tail that connects the body of the neuron to the other neurons, which are often referred as synapses in the Deep Learning terminology. 

Then the signals are passed to other receptors through the Synapses. Then the cell body sums all those input signals to generate output. The same idea is used in the ANN. Multiple input signals, referred as Input Layer Neurons, are transmitted to Hidden Layer Neurons, which on its turn are used to predict the output, Output Layer. In the sense, input signals are similar to the human senses, such as human sight, hearing, smelling, tasting and touching, only in the case of ANN, those input signals can be various type of features characterizing an observation. This process is visualized by the Figure 2 which shows an example of ANN with 3 input signals forming the Input Layer Neurons set, 3 Hidden Layers and 1 Output Layer.
